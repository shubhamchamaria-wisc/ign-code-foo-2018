Hey,

My name is Shubham Chamaria and I'm a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science.

On my 7th birthday, my dad gifted me a Gameboy SP and changed my life. I've owned the Gameboy SP, PS2, Wii, PSP, PS3 and now the PS4. During this entire journey IGN has been there with me. I would stay up reading about games and the IGN score for games was my golden standard while making a decision on a particular game.

The reason I believe I'm best suited for the internship is that being a gamer teaches you a lot about gaming and that knowledge is essential to work at a company like IGN. Also, I believe in going above and beyond what is asked of me. In my application, there are several examples of this. I completed both the backend and frontend challenges because coding isn't something I think of as work but just another problem that my brain needs to solve. Even in the Henny Penny challenge, I made my code dynamic so it will work for differently sized grids.

I would be elated if I would be given a chance to work somewhere that has influenced me as greatly as IGN. More than anything, it would be a personal quest to make IGN even better so others could have the same amazing experiences I did growing up.

Regards,
