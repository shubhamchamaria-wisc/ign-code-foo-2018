When I first read the Geomags problem, I admit I was a bit lost. 
Problem solving is my strong suit so I decided to tackle this in an unorthodox way.
I had some Geomags lying around so I started researching on tutorials to build an eiffel tower with them.
During this, I stumbled upon someone's small-scale model.
It was 4.75 ft tall and used about 3000 geomags.
The height of the eiffel tower is 1063ft.

Ratio = 224:1

Multiplying 224 and 3000, I have reached the conclusion that about 672,000 geomags would be required to build a full-size Eiffel Tower.

Answer = 672,000 geomags
