usage: java Chicken 'filename'
  
A starting 'grid.txt' is given as reference. Feel free to change it to test the code on different grids.
The letters 'O' and 'X' are used to signify walkable coordinates and potholes respectively.

I implemented a recursive algorithm to figure out the number of paths and the rest was pretty simple.
I also used Java's rand function to randomize the starting coordinate. Also added some code to make sure it doesn't start on a pothole.

The code is dynamic and will work on differently sized grids.
